# Application of Interpretability Methods to ML modelss
- This is a collaborative project with @terrinSandhu in which we explore methods for understanding feature importance to brain age prediction models
- We use a model developed by collaborators at UCL (Paper and Github Repo: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811922000015)
- This model utilizes an out of the box DenseNet from MONAI
