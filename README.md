# FMRI_CNN_explainability
Engineering Psych

This project is based heavily on a deep learning model resulting from the work of the collaborators at University College London. The convolutional neural network takes in 3D MRI scans and corresponding two dimensional saliency maps from particular slices of that scan. From this information. The model is able to predict the age of a healthy human brain. It has been trained on an exhaustive dataset. From this existing model our project plans to use a wide host of explainable Artificial intelligence methods. This includes but is not limited to looking at the guided backpropagation methodology used, investigating the model with layerwise relevance propagation, and data visualization techniques for extrapolating correlations. In reaching these goalposts, we can then use the results to determine spatially which locations contribute the most to perceived brain aging. A major foreseeable challenge will be the reconciliation of medical knowledge with the technical methodology used to explore explainability of the models This gap will be addressed as encountered via strong communication with the expertise with the project's mentors. The data is stored on UCSD Center for fMRI â€˜s servers and may be accessed via login and download.
